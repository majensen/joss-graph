# Cron setup 

Put the [scripts](./scripts) in `/etc/cron.daily`.

Create `/etc/joss/jossenv`, populate with environment variable settings for `GHCRED`, `NEO_URL`, `NEOUSER`, `NEOPASS`, `JGLOG`.

Suggested setting:

    JGLOG=/var/log/jossgraph.log

`jossgraph` script: 

Runs the Docker container
[`maj1/jg_manager`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/maj1/jg_manager),
(see [../docker](../docker)), which queries Github for JOSS updates,
creates Cypher from these to update the graph, and loads the Cypher
using [`neo4j-client`](https://github.com/majensen/libneo4j-client).

`jg-capture-log` script:

Checks if a log file generated by the `jossgraph` script is available,
when `jossgraph` is not running. Pushes this logfile to syslog with
`logger`,
and removes the log file.
